# Java-Calculator
This is a calculator designed using java awt and many other features. This specailly designed calculator can be able to calculate the fibnoccai numbers and factorials too.

General instructions 
					
					* FACT: to find the factorial of a given number the number shoud be entered in text field of first number
					
					* FIB:  to find fibonacci tern of given number enterd in first text fields
					
					* POW: to find power of given number to the number in second field
							for example
								first field : 2
								second field : 3
								result = 8(2^3)
					
					* LOG : to find the log of any number in first field to natural base
					* PRIME : to tell whether the number enterd in first text field is prime or not
					
					* COMBIN & PERMU refers to combination and permutation of two given numbers 
							here first number refer to n and secondnumberrefers to r for nPr or nCr;
					
					* for sine cosine or tangent only enter the first number 
					
					* for NTHROOT enter the first number which is the number whose root is to be ound and the second number 
							is the nth term of rot
							first number =81
							second number = 4
							ans =3 (fouth root of 81 is 3)
					
					* for rest where two numbers are required enter two numbers
					
					* THERE IS A TOTAL OF 18 FUNCTIONS AND AONG THEM 10 ARE SPECIAL ONE
